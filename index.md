## Welcome
Thanks for stopping by! 

I'm an experienced researcher who loves that moment when patterns emerge and something new is discovered. Over the course of my career, I’ve explored different domains with a diverse set of clients on B2C and B2B products.

Currently, I manage a growing team of researchers where I enjoy the opportunity to connect them with the types of challenges that they're passionate about.

In my free time, you'll find me hiking, reading, or scheming about my next travel adventure.
